    title: 'Submit 6 Soil Samples to Ocean Protocol as a PoC Revenue Stream',
    description:
      'Hello! I am a PhD student doing research analysis of soil bacterial composition, I love your project and would like to contribute in a couple ways. First I would like take soil samples at the month every month for the next 4 years to track the ratios of different species of bacteria and how they relate to the different species of flora and fauna that are able to thrive as a Palm Oil Plantation is reforested. This data has value and I would like to help Masarang Foundation begin to use Ocean Protocol by doing a case study with software. I will go take the samples and analyze the bacterial makeup then submit that data to Ocean Protocol and donate the ownership of this data to Masarang Foundation. This way Masarang can improve their models and profit from sharing their data with other researchers. This milestone is for submitting the first 6 months of soil samples, it will be considered complete once all of the data is on Ocean and the asset is transferred to the Masarang Foundation. Update: Despite not receiving enough funding in this milestone. I have submitted the first months data:',
